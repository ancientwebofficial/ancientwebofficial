# Hi, I’m Ansh 👋

I’m a student and aspiring software developer focused on building strong programming fundamentals through practical, hands-on projects.

I value clean code, consistency, and understanding how systems work at a low level rather than rushing toward surface-level results.

## 🧠 What I’m working on
- Strengthening core programming and problem-solving skills  
- Learning C/C++ to better understand memory, performance, and system-level concepts  
- Building small, meaningful projects to learn by doing

## 🛠 Skills & Tools
- Programming fundamentals & logical problem-solving  
- C / C++ (learning & practice-focused)
